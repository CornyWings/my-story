Diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD, while being raised primarily by his mother, his life so far has not always been easy. 
Percy is repeatedly kicked out of school due to unexplainable events that arenâ€™t really his fault. 
While on a sixth-grade field trip to a museum, Percy faces his strangest event yet.
